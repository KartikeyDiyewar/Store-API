Store API - Backend Developer
Project Description:
Developed a comprehensive Store API using Node.js and Express, leveraging MongoDB and Mongoose for efficient data handling and ORM. The API features robust functionalities for product management, error handling, and custom middleware for seamless 404 error responses.

Key Contributions:

Environment Configuration: Utilized .env files for secure environment variable management.
Database Connection: Established a reliable connection to MongoDB using Mongoose, ensuring efficient data modeling and interaction.
Controller Development: Implemented product-related operations through well-structured controllers, enhancing the API's modularity and maintainability.
Custom Middleware: Developed middleware for error handling and 404 responses, improving the overall user experience and error management.
Data Population: Created scripts to populate the database with initial data, streamlining the setup process.
Dependency Management: Managed project dependencies via package.json, ensuring consistency across development environments.
Development Tools: Integrated nodemon for automatic server restarts, enhancing development efficiency.
Technologies Used:

Node.js: Built the server-side application with a JavaScript runtime environment.
Express: Utilized a web framework for handling HTTP requests and routing.
Mongoose: Employed an ORM for MongoDB to facilitate data modeling and interaction.
dotenv: Managed environment variables securely and efficiently.
nodemon: Automated server restarts during development for a smoother workflow.
Setup and Installation:

Install Dependencies: Executed npm install to install required dependencies.
Environment Variables: Configured necessary environment variables in a .env file.
Run the Server: Started the server with npm start using nodemon for continuous development.
API Endpoints:

GET /api/products: Retrieve a list of all products.
